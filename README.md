# Overview

I am a software engineering student at Brigham Young University-Idaho. I am interested in mobile app development and decided to create a simple unit converter app in Android Studio using Kotlin.
The app itself is very simple. It has the user input a value they would like to convert from (currently only takes in cups) and then converts it to whichever unit you select(current options include: Tablespoons, Milliliter, and Fluid Ounces).

The reason I created this app is becuase I like to cook and sometimes it's not easy to make these calculations in your head so having an app for it always makes life a little easier.

# Development Environment

I used Android Studio to develop my app. This technology makes it extremely easy to create an android app if you already have programming experience with kotlin or java. 

I used the kotlin programming language and did not use any external libraires. 
# Useful Websites

* [The Official Kotlin webpage](https://kotlinlang.org/)
* [Android for Developers](https://developer.android.com/)

# Future Work

* Create more units to convert to and have the option to change which unit you are inputting.
* Create seperate screens for seperate categories of conversion. Have a screen for Distance, Volume, Time, etc...
* Improve the UI and make it more appealing to the user.
